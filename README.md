Predicting stock price trends using ML and DL models

# 📈 Stock Market Trend Prediction

This project focuses on predicting stock price trends using various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The goal is to reduce investment risk and improve forecasting accuracy by identifying underlying patterns in historical data.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess historical stock price data
- Engineer technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
- Apply multiple ML & DL models to predict trends
- Compare model performance and visualize results

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVC, ANN, RNN, LSTM

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. Collected and cleaned historical stock data  
2. Feature engineering: Created moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.  
3. Trained and evaluated 9 ML models + 2 DL models  
4. LSTM performed best in capturing time-series patterns  
5. Visualized results for interpretability and comparison

---

## 📈 Results

- LSTM and XGBoost showed higher accuracy in time-series forecasting  
- Insights helped understand pattern shifts and volatility zones  
- Visualizations highlighted model behavior and prediction differences
